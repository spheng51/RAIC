# Generate Flow

## Preconditions

- Repo path is confirmed.
- Startup mode has been chosen.
- Open-RAIC is healthy at the selected `url`.
- Provider keys are configured.
- For self-hosted deployments, set `APP_BASE_URL` so Open-RAIC returns trusted absolute `url` / `pollUrl` links.

> Hosted OpenClaw generation is not supported in this cutover. If the user wants the hosted product, send them to `https://open-raic.com` in a browser. If they want OpenClaw-driven generation, use local mode.

## Requirement-Only Generation

If the user has already clearly asked to generate the classroom and the preconditions are satisfied, submit the generation job immediately. Do not ask for a second confirmation just before calling `/api/generate-classroom`.

Submit the job with:

```text
POST {url}/api/generate-classroom
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "requirement": "Create an introductory classroom on quantum mechanics for high school students"
}
```

Only send supported content fields:

- `requirement` (required)
- optional `pdfContent`
- optional `language` (`"zh-CN"` | `"en-US"`, defaults to `"zh-CN"`)
- optional `enableWebSearch` (boolean)
- optional `enableImageGeneration` (boolean)
- optional `enableVideoGeneration` (boolean)
- optional `enableTTS` (boolean)
- optional `agentMode` (`"default"` | `"generate"`)

All optional boolean fields default to `false` when omitted. Omitting them preserves backward compatibility.

### Feature Detection

Before sending optional feature flags, query `GET {url}/api/health` and check the `capabilities` object:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "...",
  "capabilities": {
    "webSearch": true,
    "imageGeneration": false,
    "videoGeneration": false,
    "tts": true
  }
}
```

Only set a feature flag to `true` if the corresponding capability is `true`. If the server does not return `capabilities` (older version), do not send the new fields.

Do not rely on request-time model or provider override parameters.

Treat the `POST` response as job submission only. Expect fields such as:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "jobId": "abc123",
  "status": "queued",
  "step": "queued",
  "pollUrl": "http://localhost:3000/api/generate-classroom/abc123",
  "pollIntervalMs": 5000
}
```

Final poll responses may now include additive completion metadata for usable-but-incomplete classrooms:

- `completionStatus`: `"complete"` or `"partial"`
- `warnings`: structured generation warnings
- `result.totalScenes`
- `result.warnings`
- `result.sceneOutcomes`

## PDF-Based Generation

1. Resolve the absolute path to the PDF.
2. Confirm before reading the file.
3. Parse the PDF first:

```text
POST {url}/api/parse-pdf
```

4. Then send `requirement` plus `pdfContent` to:

```text
POST {url}/api/generate-classroom
```

## Polling Loop

After the job is submitted:

1. Save `jobId`, `pollUrl`, and `pollIntervalMs`.
2. Do not submit another generation job while this one is still `queued` or `running`.
3. Poll:

```text
GET {pollUrl}
```

4. Prefer a conservative polling cadence of about 60 seconds between polls for classroom generation jobs, even if `pollIntervalMs` is shorter.
5. Treat `queued` and `running` as in-progress states.
6. Stop only when `status` becomes `succeeded` or `failed`.
7. Treat `status: "succeeded"` plus `completionStatus: "partial"` as usable but incomplete, not as a hard failure.

### Reliability Rules

- Never restart the job just because a poll request fails once.
- If a poll request returns a transient network error or `5xx`, wait about 60 seconds and retry the same `pollUrl`.
- If the job is still running after many polls, tell the user it is still in progress and continue polling instead of resubmitting.
- Prefer fewer poll attempts over aggressive polling. Long-running jobs are more likely to survive agent-loop limits if the tool-call cadence stays low.
- Within a single agent turn, cap active polling to about 10 minutes. If the job is still not finished, tell the user it is still running and include the `jobId` and `pollUrl` so a later turn can continue checking without resubmitting.
- Report progress to the user only when `status`, `step`, or visible progress meaningfully changes. Do not spam every poll result.
- Do not try to recover from auth, provider, model, or base URL errors by changing request parameters. Tell the user to fix Open-RAIC server-side config and retry only after they confirm.
- On `failed`, surface the server error and include the `jobId`.
- On `succeeded`, use `result.id` and `result.url` from the final poll response.
- If `completionStatus` is `partial`, surface that clearly and include a concise warning summary before the classroom link.

## If The Loop Ends First

If the job is still running when you stop active polling for this turn, tell the user that the classroom generation is still running in the background and invite them to come back a little later to continue checking the same job.

Use natural phrasing such as:

```text
The classroom generation is still running in the background.
Job ID: abc123

Check back with me in a little while and I can continue tracking this same job without starting over.
```

## What To Return

Return the generated classroom ID plus a directly clickable classroom URL.

Output the URL as a raw absolute URL on its own line.

Do not wrap the URL in:

- bold markers such as `**...**`
- markdown links such as `[title](url)`
- code formatting such as `` `...` ``
- angle brackets such as `<...>`
- markdown tables

Use a compact format like:

```text
Classroom ID: Uyh82Y32ZK
Classroom URL:
http://localhost:3001/classroom/Uyh82Y32ZK
```

If the job fails, return the job ID plus the server error.

If generation fails, surface the server error directly instead of paraphrasing it away.

If the error suggests a provider or model configuration problem, explicitly tell the user to update `.env.local` or `server-providers.yml` instead of attempting a runtime override.

## Confirmation Requirements

- Ask before reading a local PDF.
- Do not ask for a second confirmation before the generation request if the user has already clearly asked you to generate the classroom.
